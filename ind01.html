        <h1>Hey Bestie</h1>
        <p>Sometimes you might be sweet and other times you may be sour, but it doesn’t matter! 😝 I live for the surprises, and you bring zest to my life! 🍋 At first, you totally terrified me because you were so bold and sassy! 😱 However, over time, I learned that you are one of the kindest souls on this planet. I’m so glad you’re part of my world, even if I’ve wondered if you’re from outer space! </p>
